# HyLiMo

HyLiMo is a textual DSL and hybrid editor for efficient modular diagramming.
A deployed web-based version of our editor and documentation can be found at https://hylimo.github.io.
This documentation is still under construction, and thus currently focuses on the usage aspects of the editor.
For technical aspects, we refer to the code documentation.

## Important features
- Hybrid graphical-textual approach
- Live-synced editing
- Graphical edits manipulate the textual definition
- Textual DSL for defining diagrams
- Programming language features, including custom functions and control-flow constructs
- Styling
- Theming
- Modular approach, with initial support for UML class diagrams

## Example diagram
```
classDiagram {
    class("Movie")

    class("Actor") layout {
        pos = rpos(Movie, 600, 0)
    }

    Actor -- Movie with {
        over = start(Position.Left).line(end(Position.Right))
    }
}
```
